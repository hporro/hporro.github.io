List of books that I want to read this term besides the ones for university, sorted on topics and according to my personal interest inside each topic:

## Math

- Analysis, Kolmogorov
- Measure theory, San Martin
- A course on combinatorics, van Lint & Wilson

## Physics

- Continuum mechanics (Lecture Notes), Zdenek Martinec
- Fluid mechanics, Egon Krause

## Computer graphics

- Computer Graphics, Hearn & Backer
- Game Engine Architecture, Jason Gregory
- Physically based rendering from theory to implementation, Matt Parh

## Computer science

- Computational geometry, Shamos & Preparata
- Apunte de diseño y análisis de algoritmos, Navarro

This is a kind of a statement to force myself to focus on a set of things that I want to study, it's not a todo list.
I know that it's too much for a semester to study, but I think that if I don't list it I won't be able to focus in a set of topics and I'll end up reading nothing.

This sums up arround 5100 pages, so it's OK if I don't read them all. A more attainable goal is read one book of each topic, preferably the one which I'm more interested in, which sums up around 1500 pages.


Besides the list of books, I wanted to do a list of papers too, to remember that I really want to study this papers:

## Computer Graphics

- Stomakhin, A., Schroeder, C., Chai, L., Teran, J., & Selle, A. (2013). A material point method for snow simulation. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 32(4), 102.
- Klár, G., Gast, T., Pradhana, A., Fu, C., Schroeder, C., Jiang, C., & Teran, J. (2016). Drucker-prager elastoplasticity for sand animation. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(4), 103.

## Deep learning

- Kim, B., Azevedo, V. C., Thuerey, N., Kim, T., Gross, M., & Solenthaler, B. (2019, May). Deep fluids: A generative network for parameterized fluid simulations. In Computer Graphics Forum (Vol. 38, No. 2, pp. 59-70).
- Ladicky, Lubor & Jeong, SoHyeon & Bartolovic, Nemanja & Pollefeys, Marc & Gross, Markus. (2017). Physicsforests: real-time fluid simulation using machine learning. 22-22. 10.1145/3098333.3098337.


First two papers are interesting models of physically based simulation, the ther two are ways to train neural networks to do physical simulations in real time.
